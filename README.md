# MakePaper
#### Generate a typical college paper/report template in LaTeX

To run, you must have scala installed and type the folling in the installed directory:

`scala MakePaper.scala [filetocreate.tex]`

or

```
scalac MakePaper.scala
scala MakePaper [filetocreate.tex]
```

Specifying the filename when you run the program is optional, it will just ask otherwise.
